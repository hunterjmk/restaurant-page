Helo y'all,

Glad we are here. This is a project that put in practise all I learnt on npm, modules, bundling etc. I'll also get to do some dom manipulation.

From the looks of the project brief, it looks super simple and straightforward. I have a clear picture of what I need to do. Unlike the tic tac toe project, I am fairly confident of getting this done soon.

Cheers!
